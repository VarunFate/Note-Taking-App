        Another productive way to use this tool to begin a daily writing
        routine. One way is to generate a random paragraph with the intention to
        try to rewrite it while still keeping the original meaning. The purpose
        here is to just get the writing started so that when the writer goes
        onto their day's writing projects, words are already flowing from their
        fingers.

      <div class="its-not-only">
        It's not only writers who can benefit from this free online tool. If
        you're a programmer who's working on a project where blocks of text are
        needed, this tool can be a great way to get that. It's a good way to
        test your programming and that the tool being created is working well.
